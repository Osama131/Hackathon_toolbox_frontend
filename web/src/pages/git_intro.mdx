# Introduction to Git

## What is Git?
Git is the most popular **distributed version control system** that is used to track changes in source code during software development.

What does that mean, you ask? Well, it means that Git helps you keep track of changes in your codebase. It allows you to save different versions of your code, and you can go back to any version at any time. This is especially useful when you're working on a project with multiple people, as it helps you keep track of who made what changes and when.


Here's a two-minute video that explains what this means:

<div style={{
      position: 'relative',
      overflow: 'hidden',
      width: '98%',
      paddingTop: '56.25%' /* 16:9 Aspect Ratio (divide 9 by 16 = 0.5625) */
    }}>
  <iframe
        style={{
          position: 'absolute',
          top: '0',
          left: '0',
          width: '100%',
          height: '100%'
        }}
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ReR1YJrNOM?si=HnDCSH-kbLqFUw-t"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
        allowfullscreen
      ></iframe>
</div>

## Why use Git?
If you are working on a project that involves:
- collaborating with other people,
- keeping track of changes in your codebase,
- working on multiple features at the same time,
- trying out different things without breaking your code,
- being able to go back to a previous version of your code,
- being able to work on your code from different devices,
- working offline and syncing your changes later,
- or just being able to sleep at night knowing that your code is safe and sound,

then you should definitely use Git.

## Getting started
### Installing Git
Frist, you ned to have Git installed on your computer.  
<Tabs items={['Windows', 'Linux', 'Macos']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>       
            If you already have [Chocolately package manager](https://chocolatey.org/) installed, you can install Git by running the following command in your terminal:
            ```bash copy
            choco install git
            ```
            If you do not have Chocolately, you can still install Git by downloading the installer from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/). Run the installer and follow the instructions in the installer.
    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab> 
        Some Linux distributions come with Git pre-installed. You can check if Git is installed on your system by running the following command in your terminal:
        ```bash copy
        git --version
        ```
        If Git is not installed, you can install it using your [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_package_management_systems#Linux). For example, on Ubuntu, you can install Git by running the following command in your terminal:
        ```bash copy
        sudo apt-get install git
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

    <Tabs.Tab> 
        There are several ways to install Git on macOS. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time.
        ```bash copy
        git --version
        ```
        If you don't have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

        Another easy way to install Git is by installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and then running the following command in your terminal:
        ```bash copy
        brew install git
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

To verify that git is installed, you can run 
``
git --version
``
in your terminal and you should see the version of Git that is installed on your system.



### Your first repository
Git works by creating a **repository** (aka repo) that contains all the files and folders in your project. You can think of a repository as a folder that contains all the versions of your code. When you make changes to your code, Git keeps track of those changes and saves them in the repository. You can then go back to any version of your code at any time.


You can either create a new repository or clone an existing repository.
<Tabs items={['Clone an existing repo', 'Create from scratch']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>

    ```bash copy
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
    You can get `repository-url` from the repository you want to clone. This is often shown on the repository's page on the platform where the repository is hosted (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

    Here's an example of where you can find the repository URL on GitHub:
    { /* ![GitHub repository URL](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/https-url-clone-cli.png) */}

    <img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/https-url-clone-cli.png" alt="GitHub repository URL" style={{ width :'98%', maxWidth: '500px' }} />   

    You'll notice that there are more than one way to clone a repository. You can use the `https` URL or the `ssh` URL. The `https` URL is easier to use, but the `ssh` URL is more secure and doesn't require you to enter your username and password every time you push changes to the repository. If you're not sure which one to use, you can use the `https` URL.

    <summary>Did you notice that there is a third option called "GitHub CLI"? </summary>
    This is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with _**GitHub**_ from the command line. You can learn more about it [here](https://cli.github.com/).
