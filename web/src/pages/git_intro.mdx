# Introduction to Git

## What is Git?
Git is the most popular **distributed version control system** that is used to track changes in source code during software development.

What does that mean, you ask? Well, it means that Git helps you keep track of changes in your codebase. It allows you to save different versions of your code, and you can go back to any version at any time. This is especially useful when you're working on a project with multiple people, as it helps you keep track of who made what changes and when.


Here's a two-minute video that explains what this means:

## Why use Git?
If you are working on a project that involves:
- collaborating with other people,
- keeping track of changes in your codebase,
- working on multiple features at the same time,
- trying out different things without breaking your code,
- being able to go back to a previous version of your code,
- being able to work on your code from different devices,
- working offline and syncing your changes later,


- or just being able to sleep at night knowing that your code is safe and sound,

then you should definitely use Git.

## How does Git work?
Git works by creating a **repository** that contains all the files and folders in your project. You can think of a repository as a folder that contains all the versions of your code. When you make changes to your code, Git keeps track of those changes and saves them in the repository. You can then go back to any version of your code at any time.

### Repository

A **local repository** is a repository that is stored on your computer. You can create a local repository by running the `git init` command in your project folder. This will create a hidden folder called `.git` that contains all the information about your repository.

A **remote repository** is a repository that is stored on a server. You can create a remote repository on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. You can then push your changes from your local repository to the remote repository, and pull changes from the remote repository to your local repository.
